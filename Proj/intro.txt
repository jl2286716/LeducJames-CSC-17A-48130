The television turns to static.
You turn to the other channels for further info...
Nothing but static.

You pick up your cellphone to check on your family and friends...
No service.

You walk into the living room when you hear an explosion in the distance.
The windows shake and the power goes out.

You hear faint screams accompanied by the neighborhood dogs barking frantically.
The screams grow nearer!
